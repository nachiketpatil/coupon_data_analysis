# coupon_data_analysis
This is practical analysis of coupon data. The data is taken from UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.
